= Abstract

As part of my 4th-year engineering internship, I joined the Centre Spatial de l'Ã‰cole Polytechnique (CSEP) to contribute to the development of the IonSat nanosatellite. I was a member of the flight software and FPGA team, with responsibilities focusing on the hardware architecture of the on-board computer and the development of a CAN protocol IP.

My first task consisted in designing a CAN protocol IP, by adapting an existing core to ensure compatibility with IonSat's hardware platform. The IP was modified to support the AXI4-Lite protocol from Xilinx, and the identified issues were corrected. I then validated all functionalities through comprehensive tests, documented in a report detailing the targeted use cases. Finally, I produced a production-ready package, including user documentation, C device drivers, and integration examples.

In parallel, I contributed to the implementation of IonSat's FPGA platform, integrating various IPs covering both ground-station communication and the control of on-board equipment. I also developed and adapted automation scripts for Vivado, in order to simplify project generation and compilation across different hardware targets.

This internship allowed me to strengthen my skills in VHDL development and low-level programming, while deepening my experience with automation and software integration tools. It also confirmed my professional ambition to pursue a career in FPGA and embedded software development for the aerospace sector.
